<section>
  <p>Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by the greek philosopher Zeno in the 3rd century BCE. The four main virtues of stoicism are:<strong> Courage, Temperance, Justice, and Wisdom</strong>. The stoics believe that our wealth, status, power, possesion and stature are neither good or bad, and that they have no importance in our relationships with each other.</p>
