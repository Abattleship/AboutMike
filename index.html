  <h1> About Mike</h1>
  <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Mike Barnes" class="me">
  <p class="about"> I was born on October 31st, 1991 in Fridley, Minnesota. My family moved to Colorado when I was a toddler and for the most part it is where I have spent my life. I graduated from Chaparral High School and immediately entered the United States Navy as a Hospital Corpsman where I served for 3 years. After my service, I bounced around a myriad of professions. The coolest job I have ever had was being the News Director for 13 radio stations in the Big Horn Radio Network in Cody, Wyoming. Currently I work in Title Insurance for Fidelity National Title.<br> <br>
I have been a gamer for all of my life. My favorite games include Old School Runescape, World of Warcraft, and League of Legends. I enjoy reading about history. Specifically, I love looking back at the Roman Republic/Empire and to ancient Greece. Lately, I have been reading about the various stoic philosophers from those eras and trying to put some of their wisdom to use in the present. My favorite movie is <i> The Shawshank Redemption</i>. My favorite musician is <em>NF</em>.</p>
